**According to the official documentation, React is a JavaScript (JS) library (not framework) for creating user interfaces (UIs).** 

It was built in a combined effort by teams from Facebook and Instagram. React was first introduced to the world in 2013, and has taken it by storm, with community-wide acceptance and the benefit of being the technology at the heart of Facebook. 

According to official documentation, some consider React to be the V in a model-view-controller (MVC) framework, because React makes no assumptions about the rest of the technology stack used. 

You can use whatever technology you wish and you can create a single section of your app with React or React Native; you can also conveniently make changes in an already created application by incrementally adding React to it.
